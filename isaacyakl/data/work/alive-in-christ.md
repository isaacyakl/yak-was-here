> “How, then, can they call on the one they have not believed in? And how can they believe in the one of whom they have not heard? And how can they hear without someone preaching to them?” ― Romans 10:14 NIV

## WooCommerce

The main sales channel is a WooCommerce installation which I setup and manage. Because I bootstrapped this business, I wanted to use existing hosting resources, and, therefore, WordPress + WooCommerce was the best ecommerce option.

## Designs

All of our designs are meant to be eye-catching and feature a scripture reference with the aim of sparking conversation or questions.
