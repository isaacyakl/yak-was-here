summary: "This is my personal website, built using NextJS and written in TypeScript. It features my portfolio, contact info, blog, social media links, and a web-based résumé. My site experiments with using CSS relative viewport units for element sizing and layouts instead of media queries and breakpoints, meaning it has a single layout."

## Prototyping

Because I had not revised my personal website in years, I started generating ideas. I first came up with some concepts on paper before moving two of the best ideas to Figma, where I could test them with multiple screen sizes. Eventually, I moved forward with the second, more professional-looking one. Of course, the end result had some changes after testing and feedback.

## Viewport units and a single layout

When designing this website, I wanted to see if it was possible to make a website without media queries and breakpoints. I essentially wanted to make a website which had only a single layout. My solution: CSS relative viewport units &mdash; vw, vh, vmin, and vmax.

For a couple of reasons, I wasn't sure it would be possible. It meant finding element sizes that worked for all screen dimensions; that the website would have a persistent hamburger menu; and that desktop browsers would not be able to zoom-in. However, after much testing, I found it was possible, and the simplicity of the design made it ideal for my use case.

All of the element sizing is based upon the body's **`font-size`**, which is a `vmax` unit. As the window size changes, the body font size changes as well, and all elements in turn. This is by design due to my use of `rem`, `em`, and other relative units. Whenever elements need to reflow (say from 2 columns to 1 column) on small displays, I use **`max-width`** and **`display:`**`flex`.

I think it turned out pretty nicely, and the few downsides can still be addressed with solutions in the future (I have ideas). Let me know what you think.
